# Geode Performance #

The Geode Performance project is used for running performance tests on a GemFire cluster. 

The performance test simulates a Geode client running with a number of concurrent connections (controlled by the -C argument) defined to the client connection pool and performing Geode get and put operations to a single region using the domain object as the region entry. The region entry key is comprised of the key header prefix with a 10 digit sequence starting with sequence number zero (0). The size of the domain object is controlled by the -S size argument.

Each callable thread runs a cycle that performs Geode get and put operations. The cycle is repeated after waiting for a defined idle time (controlled by the -I argiument in milliseconds). After each cycle, the performance test checks to see if the test duration has expired (controlled by the -E argument in minutes) and if the duration has not expirted it starts the next cycle and continues until the performance test durtion time has expired. The number and the times to perform the get/put operations are captured for each read and write performed in the cycle and is saved in the Timing object (The read rate is controlled by the -R argument and the write rate is controlled by the -W argumeng).

During the initialization phase, the performance test will seed the region with 100 times the number of reads (defined by the -R argument) objects and the read portition of the cycle gets a random key (from seeded objects) to perform the get operations.

Multiple performance tests can be run concurrently to simulate multiple clients connection to the Geode cluster.

***Example***

    java -cp conf/:lib/* util.geode.performance.Performance -C 100 -N TestPartition -R 10 -W 3 -I 100  
    -K TestPartitionKey -S 2048 -H 10.76.38.83 -P 10334 -E 5

The example performance test runs with 100 (-C) active connections performing 10 (-R) get operations and 3 (-W) put operations in a cycle. After a cycle, the performance test sleeps for 100ms (-I) before starting the next cycle. The performance test writes to the TestPartition (-N) region a domain object with a object size (-S) of 2048. The domain object key is prefixed (-K) TestPartitionKey along with a connection id (0-99) a dash "-" and 10 digit sequence number. The performance test will run for a 5 minute (-E) duration and connects to locator host (-H) and port (-P).
